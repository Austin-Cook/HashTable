# HashTable
A simple hash table program in C++

My Project:
- Used Git and Github to manage versions of the project
- Implemented a fully functional hash table using Dr. Beans Code
- Created a makefile with 2 targets (1) hash, and (2) test
- Used test.cpp to test functionality of HashTable.h
- Implemented load_table() function to read data from a file and add to a new hash table
- Implemented save_table() function to write data to a file from a hash table
- Call load_table() in constructor and save_table in destructor
- Implemented command line functionality with hash - print, add <item>, remove <item>
- Program loops until q is entered (to quit)
  
To Run
- make
-  ./hash (alone or with print, add <item>, or remove <item>)
-  program loops until q is entered
